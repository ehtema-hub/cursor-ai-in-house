# ShopVerse / TaskFlow Demo

A full-featured React demo application built with TypeScript, Vite, and Tailwind CSS v4. It showcases e-commerce UI, user profiles, team task management, analytics, a Kanban board, a social feed, and multi-step registration — with Playwright E2E test coverage.

## Tech Stack

- **React 19** + **TypeScript**
- **Vite 6** — dev server and build tooling
- **Tailwind CSS v4** — utility-first styling with dark mode
- **Lucide React** — icons
- **Playwright** — end-to-end testing
- **Axe (Playwright)** — accessibility checks in tests

## Getting Started

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173). The app uses hash-based routing.

### Production build

```bash
npm run build
npm run preview
```

### Task Dashboard (after login)

Accessible via **Tasks** in the top nav. Sidebar sections:

| **Settings** | Profile, notifications, privacy, and appearance settings |

## Features

### Authentication
- Email/password login and logout

- Session stored in `localStorage`

### E-Commerce
- Product search, category/material filters, price range, sorting, pagination

### Task Management
- Task CRUD with status, priority, due dates, and assignees
- Centralized state via `TaskDashboardContext`
- Stats, project progress, and activity feed derived from live task data

### Kanban Board
- Drag-and-drop between columns (HTML5 DnD)
- Search and filter by priority / assignee
- State persisted in `localStorage`

### Social Feed
- Create posts, like/unlike, comments, infinite scroll placeholder
- Mock team posts with optional images

### Analytics
- KPI cards, chart placeholders (line, bar, pie), filterable data table

### Dark Mode
- Global theme toggle in the **top navbar** (sun/moon icon)
- Persists preference to `localStorage` (`light` / `dark` / `system`)
- Also configurable in Task Dashboard → Settings → Appearance

## Testing

Install Playwright browsers (first time only):

```bash
npx playwright install
```

```bash
# All browsers
npm run test:e2e

# Chromium only (fastest)
npm run test:e2e:chromium

# Interactive UI mode
npm run test:e2e:ui
```

Run a specific suite:

```bash
npx playwright test e2e/multi-step-registration.spec.ts
npx playwright test e2e/product-search.spec.ts
```

### E2E test suites
